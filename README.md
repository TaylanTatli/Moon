Hi,

   I will post what I learnt and what I want to share on this blog aperiodically. 

   Most of posts will be about the programing skills related to R, Java and Scala. The majority of topics will cover from big data, data mining, researches on building user profiles, and how to make marketing/business analyzing models.
