Welcome to my personal website. In it you will find an evolving stream of thoughts and experiences on information security, as well as the projects I get involved in over time. Hopefully by maintaining this blog I can help someone who like me is starting in this exciting field.

I am currently based in Barcelona (thus the background of this site) and recently landed a security-related job at [Proficio](https://www.proficio.com). I decided it was the right time to make the switch after almost 4 years working as a GNU/Linux System Engineer. 

As of now I work as a SOC Analyst but my mid-term goal is to become a malware analyst. I find it truly fascinating and challenging at the sime time, how those pieces of code work and propagate across networks.

Stay tuned!
