Currently pursuing a Master's degree at ULi√®ge (Belgium) in computer 
engineering where I am following the "Intelligent Systems" specialisation.
My fields of interest are artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
and computer vision. More specifically, I like to tinker with machine learning 
techniques and apply them to various problems.

I also like to crack a joke from time to time so expect some serious and less 
serious posts.
