Currently a Master student at ULi√®ge (Belgium) in computer engineering where I
am following the "Intelligent Systems" specialisation.
My fields of interest are artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
and computer vision.

I like to crack a few jokes from time to time so expect some serious and silly 
posts.
