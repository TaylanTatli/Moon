Web development is an interesting world of open source collaboration and frankensteinian code. A bit less polished than traditional CS, with fundamentally different paradigms for organizing code, it is diverse and challenging. Not unlike with games, it deals with creating interactive experiences with users and blends creative and technical skills in fascinating ways. Moreover, given the breadth of open source code it challenges one's researching skills to seek out the best and most relevant resources for the task at hand.

Inspiration: Google Office Suite, Atom, OnLive, ....?

- Thinking back, the part I most enjoyed about game development was the *creation* of the mechanics, digging into the code, and solving problems. By comparison, the development of stories or gameplay scenarios never quite gripped me in the same way. It seems my nature gravitates more toward the technical side of things, with an interest in games mechanics-heavy games rather more experiential ones.
