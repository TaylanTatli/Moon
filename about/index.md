Are you a student interested in the application of data science, statistics, and mathematics to solve important social issues in your community and the region? Would you like to participate with like-minded individuals to build potential solutions for Zika using data science? We invite you to apply for a spot in our event, Datathon into Zika!

What is a Datathon?

Datathons are time-limited hackathon style events where participants work in teams to analyze, visualize, and mash up data, in order to deliver visualizations with particular insights and recommendations, in this case, for a specific public policy challenge related to Zika.

What is the challenge?

In the past two years, government and industry partners have begun the work of responding to the Zika epidemic through multiple channels and sectors. However, additional insights powered by data analysis could empower their work to better scale and effectiveness. This event will bring you closer to the specialists on the front lines of this effort in order to support their analysis of epidemiological, environment, and social data on the path to improving public health.

Who can participate?

Students with a background in data science, mathematics, and any other scientific research methods from the FGV and PUC-RÃ­o are welcome to apply.

Once you are registered as an individual, you will receive confirmation with more instructions about the next steps, where you will learn more about the opportunity to form your own team or join an existing team.

What does the commitment to this event include?

Two weeks before the event, you will attend the Boot Camp session (where the teams will form). Following this, you and your teammates will gain access to the virtual portal, which hosts the datasets and challenge questions. You have this time to prepare for the event until the days count down to December 2, the first day on-site at the university.

In two sessions on December 2 and 3, you and your team will collaborate in the space alongside your competitors with plenty of food and drinks included.
