## BIOGRAPHY
I earned my master degree in the University of Hong Kong, major in DATA JOURNALISM. And now work in China Business Network  DTimes as a data editor and journalist. <br>

I love coding and writing. Just began my `hello world` life. In my spare time, I am fond of reading history books and working out. Sometimes I will play some guitar and take some photographs.<br>

Nice to meet you, pal.
