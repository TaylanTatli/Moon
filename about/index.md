Welcome to my website which is the companion to my code contributions on [Github](https://github.com/vichargrave){:target="_blank"}. I write blogs describing my code and system designs that I've used in the hope that they will help people with their own development projects.

I have been coding for many years with C, C++, Java, and most recently Python. My technical interests include security, data analytics and distributed systems. Currently I work at [VWmare](https://vmware.com){:target="_blank"} helping bring the power of behavior analytics to the [Workspace ONE platform](https://www.vmware.com/products/workspace-one.html){:target="_blank"}. My specific role is to develop the analytics ETL pipeline.

When I'm not slaving away over a hot keyboard - yes I do have a life outside technology - I like spending time with my family, cooking, going to theater and movies. My family and I are cat lovers and spend time fostering semi-feral cats for future adoption - more on that later.

### My Blogging History

I got started with blogging at Trend Micro back in 2011 when I wrote a blog on what to do [when your Facebook account is stolen](http://fearlessweb.trendmicro.com/2011/smart-surfing/what-to-do-when-your-facebook-account-is-stolen){:target="_blank"} for Trend Micro's internal facing employee social network. The blog was inspired by advice I gave to one of my son's high school teachers when that very thing happened to him. The folks at Trend Micro's Simply Security website liked the piece enough to publish it on their site. A few blogs later they invited me to join the team as one of their regular bloggers. Shortly thereafter, I started contributing code on Github and writing associated blogs for my own personal website which ultimately became this site, [vichargrave.github.io](https://vichargrave.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Over the years I have written a considerable amount of software project documentation including: design specifications, functional requirements, engineering support training materials and software test set up tutorials. Many years ago I taught a course on Unix Network Programming for UC Berkeley Extension. Writing to explain how things work and are put together has always been a passion of mine.

### Cloud Security Alliance

One of my outside projects is working with the Cloud Security Alliance Top Threats Working Group. We are a group of security analysts, devops, and software development folks who research and write publications about security threats to cloud computing infrastructures.  Our most recent publication was [The Treacherous Twelve, Cloud Computing Top Threats in 2016](https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/assets/research/top-threats/Treacherous-12_Cloud-Computing_Top-Threats.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  I wrote the sections on **system vulnerabilities** and **advanced persistent threats**.

### Feral Cat Rehabilitation

My family and I are very much into cats. We have 4 of our own. We also work with <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/CA1681.html" target="_blank">Katydid Cat Rescue</a> to foster and help socialize cats that are rescued from the streets. Our goal is to help them feel comfortable being around people and eventually adopted by families that can give these beautiful animals the loving homes they deserve.

However, I take no responsibility for its suitability or use as stated in the Apache License.

### Helping You Figure Stuff Out

I get a kick out of writing blogs to help people understand programming and share points of view on technology and other topics. I hope you find the information on this site interesting and useful.

### A Look Back in Computer History

This picture shows some movers pushing an IBM 5 Mb hard drive (yes, that's right 5 **megabytes**) up a ramp in the **really** early days of computers. We've come a long haven't we?

At any rate, many thanks for visiting my website. I hope you find my code projects useful.
