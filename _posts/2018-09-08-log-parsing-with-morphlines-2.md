Morphlines is an open source parsing engine that enables you to write parsing applications that can handle a wide variety of log formats.  In [part 1](/log-parsing-with-morphlines-1){:target="_blank"} of this series on log parsing with morphlines, I described how to use morphlines scripts to parse JSON and syslog formatted text streams then output the parsed fields on *stdout*.
