Back at the end of March I saw the [Acer CB3-531-C4A5 Chromebook was on sale on Newegg](http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834315227) for the pretty decent price of $170 CAD (as of writing this, still on sale for $200 CAD), so I thought "What the hell, let's see what we can do with these Chromebook things". I was pleasently surprised and love my Chromebook, this post will take you step by step from factory fresh to running the latest and greatest Ubuntu 16.04 LTS codename "Xenial Xerus" along side the latest Chrome OS with the ability to run Ubuntu Desktop (XFCE in this case) or even specific programs in a window within Chrome OS !
 
 Tutorial coming soon...
