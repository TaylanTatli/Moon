grep: finds files based on keywords
grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlmnOopqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]] [-e pattern] [-f file]

### DESCRIPTION
The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more patterns. By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line without its trailing new-line. An empty expression matches every line. Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written to the standard output.
