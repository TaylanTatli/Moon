The Revolution OS is a documentary about the history of Linux or GNU/Linux. I think it is a very important and meaningful documentary, because it uncovers the history and the relationship about the Linux and the Open Source World.

This documentary will tell you **How/Why did the Linux project come out of the world** and introduce **the people who actually created/participated in/motivated such trends**.
Here are several milestones that I cliped from the video:
- In 1991 (version 0.01 of Linux), there were 10,000 lines of codes and only 1 user
- In 1992 (version 0.96 of Linux), there were 40,000 lines of codes and 1,000 users
- In 1993 (version 0.99 of Linux), there were 100,000 lines of codes and 20,000 users
- In 1995 (version 1.20 of Linux), there were 250,000 lines of codes and 500,000 users
- In 1997 (version 2.10 of Linux), there were 800,000 lines of codes and 3.5 million users
- In 1998 (version 2.11 of Linux), there were 1.5 million lines of codes and 7.5 million users
- In 1999 (version 2.20 of linux), there were 12 million users
- On Aug 11, 1999, Red Hat Software became the first Linux company to go public
- Eric Raymond stated that he thought the (development of) traditional software was more like a cathedral because it had some kinds of hierarchy, while the (development of) open source software was more like a bazaar because it was more flat and had less "political" boundaries
- The Netscape was one of the first companies (maybe it was the first BIG company) that made their source codes public/open source, which was sometimes threated as an action to against the Microsoft and which turned out to be the "Mozilla" project
- Richard Stallman hoped all the software can be free, and Bruce Perens thought both free and not free software shou work together, and he wrote The Open Source Denifition
- Open source is not communism because it does not force people to share
