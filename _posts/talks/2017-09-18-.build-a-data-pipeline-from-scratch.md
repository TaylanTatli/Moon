### Data Pipelines Are Everywhere

> **Data Pipeline** is a **unified system** for capturing **events** for analysis and building projects.

| source                         | Input                                 | End Point              |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| E-commerce                     | Views and Clicks                      | Recommendation Systems |
| Social Networks                | Clicks and Impressions                | User Ad Profiles       |
| Searching Engines              | PageRank                              | Sarching Ranks         |
| A/B Testing                    | A conversion data & B conversion data | Experiment Analysis    |
| Suitable for General Companies | Key Metrics and User Events           | Data Warehouseing      |

### Events

- Coarse-Grained Events

> Events are captured as by-product, stored in text logs used primarily for debugging and secondarily for analysis.

| IP Address | Timestamp               | Action | Status |
|------------|-------------------------|--------|--------|
| 127.0.0.1  | 2019/09/18 10:40:16 UTC | GET    | 200    |

For this kind of tracking:

  1. "page load" event === proxy number >= 1
  2. GET/newsfeed:
      2.1 App Load (UV, make sure this is the first time load this session)
      2.2 Timeline load (PV), user is in Group A of an A/B test

- Fine-Grained Events

> Record events like app opened, auto refresh, user pull down refresh, rather than GET/newsfeed.

**Annotate** events with contextual information such as: **view user was on** and **which button was clicked**.

**Decouple** logging and analysis. Create events for everything. However:

> A couple of popular schema-less formats are hard to change schemas, inefficiently process and require extra parsers.

### Key Components

- Easily to generate framework

Keep the process simple and clear.

- Big Message Bus

Make your system have abailty to horizontally scale out or in, less redundance and easy and dependent APIs to submit and fetch data. (Flume, Kafaka)

- Data Persistence

Store events. (S3 or HDFS)

- Workflow Management

Coordinate the tasks in the data pipeline. (oozie, Luigi)

- Serialization Framework

Convert events into bytes on the disk. Provide efficient, cross-language framework for serializing/deserializing data. (Apache Avro, Apache Thrift, Protocol Buffers)

- Batch Processing and AD HOC Analysis

Apache Hadoop (MapReduce), Apache Hive (or other SQL-on-Hadoop), Apache Spark

- Next Steps

  - Near-real time computation: Apache Storm, Apache Samza, Apache Spark Streaming
  - Sharing information: between services asynchronously ===> integrate user profile information
  - Cross-datacenter: do replication
  - Columnar storage

- Lambda Architecture

Refer to video ===> around '26:00' ===> Basically it describe a hybrid batch and streaming processing system.

### Summary

- Data Pipelines are everywhere
- Useful to think of data as **events**
- A unified data pipeline is very powerful
- Plethora of open-source tools to buld data pipeline
