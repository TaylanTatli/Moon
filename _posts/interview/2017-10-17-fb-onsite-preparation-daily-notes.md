# Foreword

I decided to write this blog to log my experience about the onsite interview about the Data Engineer @FB.

I just passed two stages of this interview process -- the phone interview with HR and the online coding interview. The onsite interview will be hold on **Oct 13, 2017**. I am happy and excited that I could be invited, but I also feel little bit nervous as this is the 1st real onsite for my whole life.

I am not sure whether I could take this position successfully, but I indeed hope my American Dream could come true in the end ;p

# Daily Logs

This section will be used to record all my diaries about the preparation I made for the onsite interview. (*Hope I could update it everyday ;p*)

"Thank god, I finished all my  assignments" -- This was the first thought came into my mind yesterday night actually.

> Being assignment-free is a blessing.

Today, I spent a couple of hours to do a recap on the basic SQL knowledge in Oracle database by studying a course called [The Complete Oracle SQL Certification Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-oracle-sql-certification-course/learn/v4/overview), which covers almost basic topics about SQL.

I am feeling guilty nowwwww... These two days I did not do too many things. I felt a little bit confused after reviewing the content of onsite interview prep guide. That's a little bit demanding... especially for those business reports readings.

 However, the good thing for me is... I will not just give up. Today, my previous manager told me to "**work with the best attitude for the worst scenario**". It should be ok for me because I think I got nothing to lose...

 Today, I studied the basic Linear Search, Binary Search and how to use recursive ways to implement them respectively in Java.

 One more thing, I think I MUST start to prepare for reading those business cases. It's gonna be painful but hope it is also interesting ;p.

## 2017-10-13, Friday

Finished the interview today. 3 Full stack interview and 1 behavior interview. I think I perform well in the coding and just ok in the product sense one. However, for modeling and the behavior one, actually, I think I could perform better.

Very intensive interviews though. Since sign the NDA, I won't talk too much about it here. However, this interview brings me sort of positive experience and let me know how I should improve myself.

## 2017-10-17, Tuesday

Today, I got the rejection email. I am little bit upset, but still keep faith because actually, I got nothing to lose.

I did not even apply this position by myself, and look back to the middle of August, one hr proactively contacted me and asked that whether I was interested to take the challenge. At that moment, I did not even know anything about algorithms and my Java sucks. lol, I did not know how dare I was, but I just replied YES.

This is really an interesting journey for me, although I hope it could be more perfect. Maybe one day, I will come back and take it.
