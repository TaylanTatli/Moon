*Role: Editor, community helper, administrator*

*[360 UAIC](http://360.uaic.ro)* was conceived as a news platform that connects information to students, teachers and other interested parties to the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi. The project features an opinion-section, dedicated to the teaching staff. For this site, I’ve written articles about cultural events, job and practice opportunities (national and international) and information dedicated to the students of our University. After the latest redesign, the number of unique users has increased by 23%, the people subscribed to the site’s newsletter is greater than 8600 [2014].
