Hi, welcome to **NOWHERE**.

This is my personal Jekyll blog and hosted on Github.

I am planing to use this blog to share what I've learnt and experienced from my study and life.

I'd like to treat this blog as a technical blog becasue I thought it might be a good way for me to enhance my corresponding skills and to share ideas with you guys. Most of them will be about the programing skills related to R, Java or Scala. The majority of topics will cover from big data, data mining, hadoop framework, spark, user profile, and building marketing/business analyzing models.

If you have any quesitons or suggestions about the content I released, you are all welcome to post your opinions below my every post, and you could also send an email to<a href="mailto:no_wheree@outlook.com"> me.</a>

*Test the code blocks*:

{% highlight r %}
print("Welcome to NOWHERE")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Welcome to NOWHERE");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scala linenos %}
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Welcome to NOWHERE")
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
