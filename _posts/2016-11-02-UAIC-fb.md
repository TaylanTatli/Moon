*Role: Content creator, strategist and facebook community manager*

Observing the rapid increase of millennials’ use of social-media, especially facebook, the MEDIA department decided that the communication-effort must adapt to the communication tendency of our target and the University must “talk” to its students on facebook. From March 2011 to date, we’ve gained over 76.000 fans, we’ve been constantly adapting our facebook strategies to fit the needs of the students. For example, when I first started offering feedback for our prospective students, I’ve answered hundreds of questions on the Admission site; this year however (2014), over 90% of the questions were asked on the University’s facebook page, and this situation is taking place even during the academic year. The University’s facebook page doesn’t communicate to students exclusively, 38.4% of our fans being over 25 years old. (2014).
