# Share and Save Your Bookmarks!
*Webmarks is an app for saving and sharing bookmarks. Users can organize their bookmarks into topics, "like" other user's bookmarks, and add new bookmarks to their list via email.*

### Tools
[Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Rspec](http://rspec.info/), [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit), [Embedly](http://embed.ly/), [Mailgun](https://github.com/jorgemanrubia/mailgun_rails), [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

# The Task
*[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is used to handle authentication, with [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) used to ensure other users cannot add or delete the bookmarks or topics of other users. [Mailgun](https://github.com/jorgemanrubia/mailgun_rails) is used to allow users to add new bookmarks via email. It does this by allowing the user to send an email to a test email on the mailgun servers, which will route to the Webmarks app on heroku, parse out the email contents, and generate a new bookmark from the resulting data.*

# Challenges
*While confusing at first, configuring Mailgun was relatively simple. Where I encountered some resistance was in generating thumbnails for the bookmarks. One of my personal goals was with this project was to add a little more visual flare to this project and acclimate myself more to CSS styling. Overall I think that effort was successful.*

<!-- TODO did not end up using favicons. Takes first image from page. -->
<!-- TODO missing authorization for creating bookmarks (should not allow if not logged in) -->
<!-- TODO missing input validation/parsing with/without 'www'-->

*I ended up settling on using Embedly to handle auto-generation of bookmark thumbnails. My initial thought was to have it show a snapshot of the page, but when I realized that would be too tricky, I settled on having it render the favicon instead. Given the low resolution of favicons for some sites, I think blowing them up was not the most effective method, but it suits my purposes for the assignment. Given the amount of negative space on the page, I wanted to make them bigger. In retrospect, I would probably just stick to keeping them close to their original size and settle for smaller text and content.*

# Overall
*This was a fairly straightforward project that nonetheless taught me a few new tricks with email integration. I spent more time on styling on this one, which helped me get more confident with CSS positioning.*
