### Synthesis

Just read a couple of sections of the article [Adescriptive Literature Review and Classification of Cloud Computing](http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3672&context=cais) and I found this is really a good article, which gives a brief overview of cloud computing and presents the classification of the cloud computing research. This report is worth being read by people those who are just approach to cloud computing or are about to learn cloud computing, especially for its first three sections.

By quoting from the NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology), a typical cloud computing model should have 5 necessary characteristics, four deloyment models and three service levels. Next, I will extract such contents and list the essence  of them below.

### Five Characteristics

- **On-demand self-service**:

> consumers can independently launch/provision the computing capabilities without the help from and the interaction with vendors.

- **Broad network access**:

> the access of the computing network should be available for different client platform such as mobile phone, laptop, pc and PDAs.

- **Resource pooling**:

> service vendors/providers use the multitenant model to deliver the service to multiple customers, in terms of storage, memory, network bandwidth and virtual machines.

- **Rapud elasticity**:

> the service should have ability to quickly scale in and scale out automatically or manually.
- **Measured service**:

> the service should be capable of proactively controlling and optimizing the resource by activate some kind of metering capability corresponding to different situation.

### Four Deployment Modes

- **Public cloud**:

> is owned and operated by independent vendors and can be accessible to general public, and usually when people talk about the "cloud computing", they actually refer to the public cloud.

- **Private cloud**:

> is owned by some independent groups for only interal use and is not accessible to general public.

- **Community cloud**:

> is shared among and managed by several groups and organizations and is also not accessible to general public.

- **Hybrid cloud**:

> contains two or three modes mentioned above.

### Three Service Levels

- **Infrastructure as a Service**:

> IaaS provides the most basic low level materials and resources to the cloud computing, in terms of hardware resources, networks, storage spaces and processing power.
[e.g. Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

- **Platform as a Service**:

> PaaS jumps one more step up the IaaS and it provides programming and execution environments to customers so that those customers do not need to too much about the task related to system adminstration and can concentrate more directly on the productive problem.
[e.g. Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

- **Software as a Service**:

> SaaS lies on the top level among the three service levels and it provides customers the most business-focusing service which means users can directly use the software to solve their business problems without or just with a little customized development.
[e.g. Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/)
